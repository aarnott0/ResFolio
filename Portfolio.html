                <p>Looking to showcase your work to an art gallery, to a university, or for an employer? An art portfolio is a great way <br> to highlight  all of your best pieces and show your abilities.<br> A portfolio should speak for itself and combine professionalism, passion, personality, and a variety of pieces that  <br> have been inspired by you. <br>It will be your first impression and needs to stand out amongst other submitted portfolios.<br> In your portfolio you want to show whoever you are catering to your talent, what makes you stand out from the rest, <br> and why they should choose your portfolio over someone else's.</p>

                <img src="Images/Compiling.png" alt = "Compiling Pieces">
                <p>1. Look up the requirements for your portfolio. Every organization is different and so they may require different <br> things within your portfolio or a different format for your portfolio. Your portfolio will also depend greatly on the type <br> of study or career you are interested in pursuing.
                <p>
            

           
                <h2>Part 2. Assembling the Portfolio</h2>
                <img src="Images/Assembling.png" alt = "Assembling the Portfolio">
                <p>1. Use other portfolios as examples. The best way to begin a project like a portfolio is to find other successful portfolios <br> online and use those as your guide.<br> This doesn't mean copy the format, or follow the portfolio piece by piece, but it means to use it as a reference as you <br> being making yours.</p>
            

           
                <h2>Part 3. Preparing to show your Portfolio</h2>
                <img src="Images/Practice.png" alt = "Practice Presenting">
                <p>1. Practice presenting your portfolio. If you have the opportunity to show your portfolio in person, it's important to <br> practice going through it, knowing what you will say for each piece and how you can effectively communicate why <br> you think your work stands out and is valuable.</p>

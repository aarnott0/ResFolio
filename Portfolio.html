            <h1>How to create a professional Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Looking to showcase your work to an art gallery, to a university, or for an employer? An art portfolio is a great way to highlight all of your best pieces and show your abilities.<br> A portfolio should speak for itself and combine professionalism, passion, personality, and a variety of pieces that have been inspired by you. <br>It will be your first impression and needs to stand out amongst other submitted portfolios.<br> In your portfolio you want to show whoever you are catering to your talent, what makes you stand out from the rest, and why they should choose your portfolio over someone else's (Gallagher, 2021).</p>

            <h4>1. Look up the requirements for your portfolio. Every organization is different and so they may require different things within your portfolio or a <br>different format for your portfolio.  Your portfolio will also depend greatly on the type of study or career you are interested in pursuing (Gallagher, 2021).</h4>

            <img src="Images/Assembling.png">
            <h4>1. Use other portfolios as examples. The best way to begin a project like a portfolio is to find other successful portfolios online and use those as your guide.<br> This doesn't mean copy the format, or follow the portfolio piece by piece, but it means to use it as a reference as you being making yours (Gallagher, 2021).</h4>

            <img src="Images/Practice.png">
            <h4>1. Practice presenting your portfolio. If you have the opportunity to show your portfolio in person, it's important to practice going through it,<br> knowing what you will say for each piece and how you can effectively communicate why you think your work stands out and is valuable (Gallagher, 2021).</h4>

        <!-- If you wish to become a perfectionist, HTML coding is an excellent place to commence, as there is no room for error. Adhering to the essential aspect of the web design process, structural elements such as HTML tags must be used to define areas. Once opening a tag, it is important to remember to close it. -->
        <!-- Grouping is also essential, beginning and ending with the grandparents, then indenting for the parents and indenting once more for the children. -->

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Lets start by being aware of the difference between a portfolio and a resume.</p>
                    <p>A portfolio is a collection of knowledge and material that offers a visible example of a person’s skilled field.</p>
                    <p> It contains in-depth data on a person’s skills, expertise, and achievements. Since it’s one of these, it’s long and <br> takes longer to make.</p>
                    <p>A portfolio is employed to impress the employers in an interview and receive the job by showcasing that the candidate <br> is an expert with all the relevant skills.</p>
                    <p>A resume is a document that summarizes a person’s abilities, achievements, and skills.</p>
               
            </article>
            <!-- this is a segment of text, to seperate the heading and make it bolder, a <h> is needed before the paragraph <p> -->
            <!-- html allows a hierarchy of h1 (largest text) to h6 (smallest text) -->
            <!-- <article> element represents a self contained composition -->
            <!-- <section> is a container to hold generic content and starts with a heading -->
